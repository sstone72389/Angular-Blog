AngularJS Blog/Tutorial created by Spencer Stone

Welcome to In Depth Angular. In this tuitorial we will review the basics of working with AngularJS, a popular front-end framework developed by Google. Angular automatically synchronizes data from your UI with your JavaScript objects through 2-way data binding. Angular is also useful for server-side communication as it tames async callbacks with promises and deferred objects.

Although this tuitorial uses a CDN, Node.js and npm are essential to Angular Development. It is strongly reccommended to understand these services prior to building any production applications with AngularJS.

NOTE: When working localy, it is important to make sure you are using <code class="code">http://localhost</code> or some sort of test enviornment. It is not reccomended to use the file patch located on your computer, as Angular will likely give you
a " Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP."

Enjoy the tuitorial and happy coding! </>
