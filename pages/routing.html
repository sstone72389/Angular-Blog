<h2>Routing</h2>

<p>
  I bet you've been admiring the nifty navigation in this tutorial, right?! Okay, don't answer that. But still; you should have been! I digress... A very important feature of Angular (or any useful framework nowadays) is <code class="code">routing</code>.
  "Injecting" pages into your single page application (SPA) is an essential building block to any AngularJS app. Let's check out how it works.
</p>

<p>
  First on the to-do list is to make sure you have included the correct js files.<code class="code">angular-route.js</code> must also be linked in the head of your <code class="code">index.html</code> page:
</p>

<pre class="pre"><code>&lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.6/angular-route.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
  Okay, so you may have noticed this, but I injected pages for each section you learned. The cool thing about Angular is that you don't have to inject an <em>entire</em> page, you can essentially manipulate the <code class="code">views</code> any way
  you want. It all starts with the <code class="code">ng-view</code> directive. This is where we want our views to populate. Check out my code snippet below.
</p>

<pre class="pre"><code>&lt;div ng-view&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
  Yep! That's it! That's all you need to get started.
</p>

<p>
  Okay, I guess that's not it. You still need to configure routes and views. Remember that empty array in our <code class="code">angular.module</code> that I said we'd get back to? That's right. We're going to need to add to that.
</p>

<pre class="pre"><code>var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute']);</code></pre>

<p>
  According to the docs, The <code class="code">ngRoute</code> module provides routing and deeplinking services and directives for AngularJS apps. The next step is to configure routes using <code class="code">$routeProvider</code>. As you can see by the
  configuration below, you can specify the route, the template file to use, and even a controller for each view.
</p>

<pre class="pre"><code>// script.js

        // include ngRoute module
    var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute']);

    // configure our routes
    app.config(function($routeProvider) {
        $routeProvider

            // route for home page
            .when('/', {
                templateUrl : 'pages/home.html',
                controller  : 'mainController'
            })

            // route for about page
            .when('/about', {
                templateUrl : 'pages/about.html',
                controller  : 'aboutController'
            })

            // route for help page
            .when('/help', {
                templateUrl : 'pages/help.html',
                controller  : 'helpController'
            });
    });

    // create the controller and inject Angular's $scope
    app.controller('mainController', function($scope) {
        // create a message to display in our view
        $scope.message = 'I am a home page';
    });

    app.controller('aboutController', function($scope) {
        $scope.message = 'I am an about page.';
    });

    app.controller('helpController', function($scope) {
        $scope.message = 'HELPPPP ANGULAR IS BLOWING MY MIND!';
    });</code></pre>

<p>
  As you likely noticed, our route configurations contains a templateURL. This points to the page to be injected. An example of our <code class="code">home.html</code> page can be seen below. We would need one of these for each of our respective pages configured in our routing. The message template will display the message associated with the applicable controller, if you designated one in your configuration (you aren not required to).
</p>

<pre class="pre"><code>&lt;!-- home.html --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Home Page&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;<span ng-non-bindable="">{{ message }}</span>&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> When working locally, it is important to make sure you are using <code class="code">http://localhost</code> or some sort of test environment. It is not recommended to use the file path located on your computer, as Angular will likely give you
  a " Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP."
</p>

<p>
  Okay, a couple of final thoughts before we move on. Angular throws a hash into your URLs. These can be removed if it pleases you, using <code class="code">$locationProvider</code>. We won't get into it, now, but feel free to do some digging on your own if you'd like.
</p>

<p>
  Linking to your views within the app: This is fairly easy, as we have done most of the hard work, already. Using a regular old anchor tag, we can link to our <code class="code">home.html</code> page as such (this should match the configuration in your js file):
</p>

<pre class="pre"><code>&lt;a href=&quot;home&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
  Moving on...
</p>

<nav aria-label="footer-nav">
  <ul class="pager">
    <li><a href="#data-binding">Previous</a></li>
    <li><a href="#validation">Next</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
