<h2>More on scopes</h2>

<p>
  A <code class="code">$scope</code> is a javascript object. In Angular, it ties a view (or a DOM element) to the controller. In the MVC structure, <code class="code">$scope</code> becomes the model. The controller and view both have access to this,
  allowing communication between the two. The <code class="code">$scope</code> will house both the data and functions that we run in the&nbsp;view.
