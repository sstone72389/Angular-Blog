    Javascript! Javascript!

<p>
  Okay. You asked for it. Lets get started with the javascript. First we created a new JS file and linked it in our head tag. Next we need to define an angular.module. An Angular module is a collection of functions that are run when the application is&nbsp;started.
</p>

<p>
  In our linked Javascript file, we will define our module as such: <pre class="pre"><code>var app = angular.module('myApp', [])</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  The first arguement is the name of our module. The second, empty array will be adressed,&nbsp;shortly.
</p>

<p>
  Next we must instantiate our myApp module and let Angular know where in the DOM tree to look for our app. Remember that <code class="code">ng-app</code> directive we added earlier to the <code class="code">&lt;html&gt;</code> tag? This is where we'll
  do this. It can be done by simply adding the name of our new module, like so: <code class="code">&lt;html ng-app="myApp"&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Wherever <code class="code">ng-app</code> is located in our HTML is where Angular will start. For our case, we want this to be on either the <code class="code">&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code class="code">&lt;body&gt;</code> tags, since we want the app
  to take over the entire&nbsp;page.

<nav aria-label="footer-nav">
  <ul class="pager">
    <li><a href="#intro">Previous</a></li>
    <li><a href="#scopes">Next</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
