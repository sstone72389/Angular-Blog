      Welcome to In Depth Angular by Spencer Stone. In this tuitorial we will examine the inner workings of a very popular framework developed by Google, Angular JS. Angular is a very popular framework, utilized by many organizations. Enter your name in the above input to see angular at work.

    <p>
      So what is happening above, then? Bi-directional data binding. This essentially means changing data on the back end changes your view automatically. This is a very simple example of Angular at work. Let's take a deeper look into whats happening. Ready..Set..Code!
    </p>
    </div>

    <h2>
      Lets see the code! Here are the elements we used in our app to make this happen:
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li><code class="code">ng-app</code></li>
      <li><code class="code">ng-model=“yourName”</code></li>
      <!-- ng-non-bindable directive tells AngularJS not to compile or bind the contents of the current DOM element -->
      <li><code class="code"><span ng-non-bindable="">{{ yourName }}</code></span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Wait...What is this stuff? Let's dig a little deeper, here.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>First</strong>, the <code class="code">ng-app</code> attribute is added on the <code class="code">&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. This tag allows Angular to start. Without this, the CDN used here is useless. It is ually added to root elements and could easily be applied to a <code class="code">body</code> tag as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Second</strong>, we to set up bi-directional data binding on the yourName model simply by ading <code class="code">ng-model="yourName"</code> to the input.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Lastly</strong>, we displayed the data yourName in the directive template called <code class="code"><span ng-non-bindable="">{{ yourName }}</span></code>. If you are fimailiar with Handlebars or Mustache, you may be recgognize this template pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is about as simple as AngularJS gets. We have yet to even touch Javascript yet; but dont worry, we'll get to that as more customized behavior becomes necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Javascript! Javascript!
    </h2>

    <p>
      Okay. You asked for it. Lets get started with the javascript. First we created a new JS file and linked it in our head tag. Next we need to define an angular.module. An Angular module is a collection of functions that are run when the application is started.
    </p>

    <p>
      In our linked Javascript file, we will define our module as such: <code class="code">var app = angular.module('myApp', [])</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first arguement is the name of our module. The second, empty array will be adressed, shortly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next we must instantiate our myApp module and let Angular know where in the DOM tree to look for our app. Remember that <code class="code">ng-app</code> directive we added earlier to the <code class="code">&lt;html&gt;</code> tag? This is where we'll do this. It can be done by simply adding the name of our new module, like so: <code class="code">&lt;html ng-app="myApp"&gt;</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wherever <code class="code">ng-app</code> is located in our HTML is where Angular will start. For our case, we want this to be on either the <code class="code">&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code class="code">&lt;body&gt;</code> tags, since we want the app to take over the entire page.
    </p>

    <h2>Scopes</h2>

    <p>
      A <code class="code">$scope</code> is a javascript object. In Angular, it ties a view (or a DOM element) to the controller. In the MVC structure, <code class="code">$scope</code> becomes the model. The controller and view both have access to this, allowing communication between the two. The <code class="code">$scope</code> will house both the data and functions that we run in the view.
    </p>

    <p>
      All AngularJS apps must have a <code class="code">$rootScope</code>. This is the top-most scope that is created on the DOM element containing our <code class="code">ng-app</code> directive. You can think <code class="code">$rootScope</code> as global variable since it is accessible everwhere in our application and <code class="code">$scope</code> as local variables.
