      Wow! Bi-directional data binding (Which essentially means changing data on the back end changes your view automatically). This is a very simple example of Angualar at work. Let's take a deeper look into whats happening...
    </p>

    <h2>
      Lets see the code! Here are the elements we used in our app to make this happen:
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li><code>ng-app</code></li>
      <li><code>ng-model=“yourName”</code></li>
      <!-- ng-non-bindable directive tells AngularJS not to compile or bind the contents of the current DOM element -->
      <li><code><span ng-non-bindable="">{{ yourName }}</code></span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Wait...What is this stuff? Let's dig a little deeper, here.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>First</strong>, the <code>ng-app</code> attribute is added on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. This tag allows Angular to start. Without this, the CDN used here is useless. It is ually added to root elements and could easily be applied to a <code>body</code> tag as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Second</strong>, we to set up bi-directional data binding on the yourName model simply by ading <code>ng-model="yourName"</code> to the input.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Lastly</strong>, we displayed the data yourName in the directive template called <code><span ng-non-bindable="">{{ yourName }}</span></code>. If you are fimailiar with Handlebars or Mustache, you may be recgognize this template pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is about as simple as AngularJS gets. We have yet to even touch Javascript yet; but dont worry, we'll get to that as more customized behavior becomes necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Javascript! Javascript!
    </h2>

    <p>
      Okay. You asked for it. Lets get started with the javascript. First we created a new JS file and linked it in our head tag. Next we need to define an angular.module. An Angular module is a collection of functions that are run when the application is started.
    </p>

    <p>
      In our linked Javascript file, we will define our module as such: <code>var app = angular.module('myApp', [])</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first arguement is the name of our module. The second, empty array will be adressed, shortly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next we must instantiate our myApp module and let Angular know where in the DOM tree to look for our app. Remember that <code>ng-app</code> directive we added earlier to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag? This is where we'll do this. It can be done by simply adding the name of our new module, like so: <code>&lt;html ng-app="myApp"&gt;</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wherever <code>ng-app</code> is located in our HTML is where Angular will start. For our case, we want this to be on either the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags, since we want the app to take over the entire page.
    </p>

  </body>
</html>
