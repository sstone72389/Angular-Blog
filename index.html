      Wow! Bi-directional data binding (Which essentially means changing data on the back end changes your view automatically). This is a very simple example of Angualar at work. Let's take a deeper look into whats happening...
    </p>

    <h2>
      Lets see the code! Here are the elements we used in our app to make this happen:
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>ng-app</li>
      <li>ng-model=“yourName”</li>
      <!-- ng-non-bindable directive tells AngularJS not to compile or bind the contents of the current DOM element -->
      <li><span ng-non-bindable="">{{ yourName }}</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Wait...What is this stuff? Let's dig a little deeper, here.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>First</strong>, the ng-app attribute is added on the &lt;html&gt; tag. This tage allows Angular to start. Without this, the CDN used here is useless. It is ually added to root elements and could easily be applied to a body tag as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Second</strong>, we to set up bi-directional data binding on the yourName model simply by ading ng-model="yourName" to the input.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Lastly</strong>, we displayed the data yourName in the directive template called <span ng-non-bindable="">{{ yourName }}</span>. If you are fimailiar with Handlebars or Mustache, you may be recgognize this template pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is about as simple as AngularJS gets. We have yet to even touch Javascript yet; but dont worry, we'll get to that as more customized behavior becomes necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Javascript! Javascript!
    </h2>

    <p>
      Okay. You asked for it. Lets get started with the javascript. First we created a new JS file and linked it in our head tag. Next we need to define an angular.module. An Angular module is a collection of functions that are run when the application is started.
    </p>

    <p>
      In our linked Javascript file, we will define our module as such: var app = angular.module('myApp', [])
    </p>

    <p>
      The first arguement is the name of our module. The second, empty array ([]) we will adress, shortly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next we must instantiate our myApp module and let Angular know where in the DOM tree to look for our app. Remember that ng-app directive we added earlier to the &lt;html&gt; tag? This is where we'll do this. It can be done by simply adding the name of our new module, like so: &lt;html ng-app="myApp"&gt; tag.
    </p>
